Per CoStar, Long Beach is listed as one of the top 5 fastest growing retail markets in the US & #1 Best Place to Live in California according to Forbes and Redfin. The Sponsor purchased Awesome Place in 2018 at a value of $2 Million Dollars. Under the Sponsor's management, the Property's value has increased by over 175% in less than 5 years. In 2022, the Sponsor refinanced the property and secured a 5 year, 4.25% fixed interest rate loan which would be generally difficult to find in today’s market. This advantage, coupled with the offering cap rate of 6.3% positions investors going in with positive leverage. Unlocking further potential, Waterfall Partners seeks to modestly increase rents through the execution of new leases and renewals. We believe that the asset's prime location, high cash flow, tenant strength, asset quality, and the high market demand make it a lucrative and reliable investment. The Sponsor intends to exit the asset in Year 3 by sale or refinance of the property. At time of exit, investors will receive 100% return of their initial capital contribution, after which any further returns will be a return on investment."},{"insert":"\n\n "},{"attributes":{"height":"81.03706395348837","width":"93"},"insert":{"image":"cid:llgtgjnx"}},{"attributes":{"align":"center"},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"height":"4.673716012084592","width":"1547","color":"#303030","font":"Verdana, sans-serif"},"insert":{"image":"cid:lkt0jk5g"}},{"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"font":"Nunito Sans","size":"13.5pt"},"insert":" "},{"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"color":"#303030","font":"Nunito Sans","size":"13.5pt","bold":true},"insert":"Attractive Going-In Basis"},{"attributes":{"italic":true,"bold":true},"insert":".
